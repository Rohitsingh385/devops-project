This tool provides a simple way to archive logs from a specified directory. It compresses the logs into a tar.gz format, stores the archive in a designated directory, and logs the operation for future reference. The tool is especially useful for managing log files, reducing disk space usage, and maintaining system cleanliness.


USAGE:

Save the script as log-archive.sh on your Linux system

make the script executable : chmod +x log-archive.sh

sudo ./log-archive.sh /var/log
